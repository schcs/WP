This is a valuable, useful, and beautiful book.\u00a0<\/i>(Pablo Spiga on MathSciNet)<\/p>\n<p><i>This is a thorough reference book that consists of three parts. The first part introduces permutation groups. A non-expert reader with graduate student\u2019s knowledge of permutation groups will probably find the second half of even this introductory part new. The second, main part is about innately transitive groups and their cartesian decompositions. [&#8230;] The book ends with a short third part consisting of applications, to other parts of the theory of permutation groups, and to graph theory. In summary, the book is an impressive collection of theorems and their proofs [&#8230;] and it seems that most readers will use the book as reference material.\u00a0<\/i>(Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na for the MAA)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Permutation Groups and Cartesian Decompositions Notes and corrections Cheryl E.
